# DSA-in-Java
Alpha Batch is the first course that I have taken in the first year of college. Here I have shared all the codes that I practiced in the course. You can see them if you see the branches section in the repository. I have uploaded almost all questions that were covered in batch.
I have learnt real life problem solving through a piece of code in this course. I have also learnt critical thinking and data structures & algorithms.
Yes I will be delightful if you contribute something here. You can find mistakes in my code, commit the corrected version of it, share the optimized any stuff and many more.
